## Installation

- [Install Hugo](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) and create a new site.
- Install Image Archive. Inside your new Hugo project run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/anatomio/hugo-image-archive-theme themes/hugo-image-archive-theme
```

- Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](//github.com/anatomio/hugo-image-archive-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](//github.com/anatomio/hugo-image-archive-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml). Copy the `config.toml` into the root folder of your Hugo site.

## Configuration

Open just-copied `config.toml` and fill it with your data. Pay attention on instructions for the contact form.

Now you are ready to create your first photopost/album.

## Posting

Inside your project run:

```
$ hugo new NAME-OF-YOUR-SECTION/NAME-OF-YOUR-POST/index.md
```
It will create an index file of your first album. Open `content/NAME-OF-YOUR-SECTION/NAME-OF-YOUR-POST/index.md` with your text editor. You'll see something like this:

```
+++
albumthumb = "/full/path/to/album/cover/image"
date = "2016-10-21T19:07:17+03:00"
title = "index"
+++

{{< photo full="path/to/first/FULL-SIZE/image/in/your/gallery.jpg" thumb="path/to/its/THUMBNAIL/image.jpg" alt="" phototitle="SOME TITLE" description="SOME SHORT DESCRIPTION. MARKDOWN **SUPPORTED**. REPEAT THIS SHORTCODE FOR EVERY IMAGE YOU HAVE IN THIS GALLERY">}}

```
Change the title of your album and set the url of album's cover. Then fill the shortcode fields with the first image data. Repeat the shortcode for every image in the gallery. You may use both local and remote images.

Create needed albums and then 

## Test your site

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server. 

    $ hugo server -w

Now enter `localhost:1313` in the address bar of your browser.

## Building the site

Just run

	$ hugo

You'll find your resume files in `public` folder in the root of Hugo project.
